## **Curated** Stories guide a viewer through the data

* The precise purpose and expectations vary depending on the use case.
* The purposes can include a graphical abstract for a paper, a digital figure, 'eye candy' for a grant or press, or an educational description of the data.

**e.g.** [Nuclear envelope atypia and rupture in human glioblastoma](https://www.cycif.org/data/coy-2024/), [Multimodal spatial profiling of colorectal cancer using Orion](https://labsyspharm.github.io/orion-crc/minerva-story/P37_S32-CRC04/index.html), [Cell State Dependent Effects of Bmal1 on Melanoma Immunity and Tumorigenicity](https://www.cycif.org/data/zhang-2023/)


## Story tab

You can open the rightmost tab to edit the waypoints of a story. In this tab, you can change the active waypoint, which will activate the corresponding field of view, group of channels, and text description.

### Select field of view and channel group

You can scroll your mouse, use your trackpad, or click-and-drag to move the active field of view through the image as shown on the right. This field of view is continuously stored to the waypoint that is currently active. You can also select a channel group with the dropdown menu on the left. This active channel group is similarly stored to the currently active waypoint.

### Add text description

A waypoint corresponds to a field of view and a group of channels. Additionally, you can add a text description within a waypoint to provide context for the field of view and associated channel group.

### Add an arrow

To annotate a specific point in an image, you can click the arrow icon on the right of the waypoints panel. Then, you can click the point in the image where you would like to add an arrow.

### Describe the arrow

You can link a text description to your arrow in order to provide a more specific label within a field of view. At the bottom of the waypoint panel, click the label that corresponds to the arrow. Then you can add a description to the arrow. You can click "Hide Arrow" to display only the description, allowing a floating text annotation over the field of view without an accompanying arrow.

### Delete arrows or regions of interest

At the bottom of the waypoint panel, you can click the "X" that corresponds to a given region of interest, arrow, or floating text annotation.
