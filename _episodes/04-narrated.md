Narrated stories build upon Curated Stories and walk a viewer through the data. The precise purpose
and expectations vary depending on the use case. Common uses cases include a graphical abstract for
a paper, a digital figure, 'eye candy' for a grant or press, or an educational description of the
data.

**e.g.** [Nuclear envelope atypia and rupture in human glioblastoma](https://www.cycif.org/data/coy-2024/), [Multimodal spatial profiling of colorectal cancer using Orion](https://labsyspharm.github.io/orion-crc/minerva-story/P37_S32-CRC04/index.html), [Cell State Dependent Effects of Bmal1 on Melanoma Immunity and Tumorigenicity](https://www.cycif.org/data/zhang-2023/)
