# How to use the red and green sticky notes

## During the session

- Post the green sticky note when you successfully finish a section of the tutorial. Instructors will let you know when to put them up. 

- Post the red sticky when you encounter an issue or get stuck for any reason. Instructors will come by to help you. 

- If your neighor has a red sticky note up, feel free to help them troubleshoot!

## At the end of the session

Use the sticky notes to write down your feedback for the session. Put your positive feedback on the green sticky note and your constructive feedback on the red sticky note.

To help you think through your feedback, you can use any of the prompts below (or mix-and-match them!):

|Green sticky note | Red sticky note|
|One thing you liked about this section of the workshop | One thing you did not like or would change about this section of the workshop |
|The most important thing you learned today | One thing that is confusing / you would like clarification on|
|A function of Minerva that you are most excited to use | One question you have|

Hand your sticky notes to a instructor or your way out.
